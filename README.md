# Xenopus_segments
My first attempt at sharing the results of my segmentation. Original data and the specimen can be found at:
https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000386521

1. **UF-H-158477_Segmentation.seg.nrrd:** is the segmentation file in Slicer's format
2. **UF-H-158477_Segmentation-models.gltf:** Contains the 3D models exported from this segmentation in glTF format.
3. **xenopus.mp4:** Is a colored volume rendering of the specimen after segmentation.
